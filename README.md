grep is a command line tool for finding matching patterns of text. It can operate on shell input or file input and is great for highlighting what you are looking for in a large amount of text.

The goal of this project is to re-implement the grep tool using Go.

## Get Start
To get started, you'll need to:
```sh
go build
./go-grep -h
```
